# Mixer (continued)
ECSE 428 - Software Engineering Practice Project

This fork of the repository contains my continuation of a project I did within a group of 10 people in the class ECSE 428 - Software Engineering Practice.

My additions were adding the inventory and search functionalities to the front-end, modifiying the search function in the back-end, and deploying the application.

I deployed the front-end (React) to Github Pages, and the back-end (Java SpringBoot) to Heroku.
